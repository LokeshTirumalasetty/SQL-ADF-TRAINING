SQL Statements:

DQL:
Commands of sql that are used to retrieve the data from database are collectively called dql statements.

DDL:

Data Definfition Language changes the structure of the table like creating a table, deleting a table, altering the table,etc.,

DML:
Data Manipulation Language commands are used to insert data,update data,delete data in sql database table.
Data Definfition Language changes the structure of the table like creating a table, deleting a table, altering the table.,etc.,

Truncate is not a DML Command as per the sql rules but in my opinion its a dml command since it doesnt affect the structure of the table.
